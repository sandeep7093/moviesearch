# moviesearch
I developed a movie search web application using the OMDB REST API, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application allows users to search for movies and view detailed information, including titles, genres, release years, and more. The project demonstrates my skills in API integration and front-end development and is hosted on GitHub for public access.
